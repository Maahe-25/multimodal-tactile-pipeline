# Multimodal Tactile & Spatial Sensor Fusion Pipeline
![Dashboard Demo](pipeline-demo.gif)


A dual-brain multimodal data pipeline that fuses 5DT tactile-glove kinematics and MediaPipe spatial tracking into a neuro-symbolic Unity dashboard.

# 🧠 System Architecture 
In this work, I am trying to meet a strict hardware/software architectural constraint: the proprietary `fglove.dll` requires a legacy 32-bit Python environment, while modern AI like MediaPipe requires a 64-bit environment. To prevent crashes, the pipeline isolates the hardware streams into two separate asynchronous Python transmitters and bridges them over local UDP ports to a unified C# receiver in Unity.

* Node 1 (32-bit Python): Extracts 5-finger float arrays from the 5DT Glove via USB. Broadcasts on UDP Port 5xxx.
* Node 2 (64-bit Python): Extracts wrist X, Y, Z spatial coordinates using OpenCV/MediaPipe. Broadcasts on UDP Port 5xxx.
* Node 3 (Unity Engine): A dual-threaded C# script ingests both streams simultaneously without frame-blocking, mapping the data to a 2D scrolling waveform UI and a live 3D spatial hand model.

⚙️ Hardware Requirements
5DT Data Glove (USB/COM connection
Standard RGB Webcam (1080p recommended), but I am using 720p
Windows OS (Required for fglove.dll execution); I got this from their SDK


🚀 Installation & Execution
1. Set up the Tactile Environment (32-bit)
You must use a 32-bit Python installation for this step. Download the official 5DT SDK and place your fglove.dll file directly into the python_32bit_tactile directory. Open a 32-bit terminal and run:
python python_32bit_tactile/transmitter.py
2. Set up the Spatial Environment (64-bit)
Open a separate 64-bit terminal (e.g., Anaconda). Install the dependencies and run the tracker:
pip install -r python_64bit_spatial/requirements.txt
python python_64bit_spatial/camera_tracker.py
3. Launch the Unity Fusion Dashboard
Open the unity_dashboard folder in Unity Hub (Unity 2022+ recommended).

Open the Main Scene and press Play.
Hardware Calibration: Once running, stretch your fingers backward as far as possible for one second, then squeeze them into a tight fist. This calibrates the 3D hand model's absolute minimum and maximum thresholds.
